## Arctic Monkeys

Over the years the Arctic Monkeys had a lot of releases. The first Album, Whatever People Say I am, That's What I'm Not, is a fast paced energetic album clearly made by boys. A lot of fans claim that over the years their releases have gotten a lot more mature and less energetic. Let's compare their releases to see if the energy and the danceability have changed. 

```{r (arctic, echo= TRUE)}
ggplot(arctic, aes(x=album_name, y=energy)) + geom_col() + theme_grey() + ggtitle("Energy of Arctic Monkey's albums")
