## Arctic Monkeys

Arctic Monkeys have had a lot of releases over the years. Their first album, Whatever People Say I am That's What I'm Not, is a fast paced boyish album. A lot of the fans claim that after a while this energy dissipated on other albums. Let's see if that's the case.


```{r arcitc, echo=false}
arctic <- get_artist_audio_features('arctic monkeys')


ggplot(arctic, aes(x=album_name, y=energy)) + geom_col() + theme_grey() + ggtitle("Energy of Arctic Monkey's Albums")
```
